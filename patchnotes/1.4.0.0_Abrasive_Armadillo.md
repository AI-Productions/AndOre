Abrasive Armadillo | v1.4 |
===========================

In the 1.4 release (titled Abrasive Armadillo),
we made many changes that positively affect a player's experience.

We rewrote our communication layer for the servers a player communicates
with most in order to reduce latency & bandwith usage. This change was
also a big step in moving towards multiple worlds.

We also added a chat feature to the game, which lets you communicate
with other players in the game. For now we only have Global Chat,
but soon we plan on adding tabs for the chat window, for things such
as Corporation, Ally, and Local Chat. The chat is moderated by an
extensive whitelist rather than a blacklist, as it's too easy to
get around a blacklist. We're consistently improving the whitelist
so over time you'll see less and less of your words wrongfully
censored to `heck`.

We also fixed an issue where if a player died on a spiketrap,
their corpse (loot) would not show up at all, you would still
only see a spiketrap there and you would not be able to enter
the cell with the spiketrap. Now the corpse (loot) shows up on
top of the spiketrap.

We've also been working on constructing a wiki, so in the next
release we should have a link to that in the game client.
