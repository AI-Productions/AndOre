===========================

None of the core developers use Windows, so we haven't tried to run it on windows. The install prequisites script won't work, neither will the setup nginx script. If you figure it out, great, please edit this and make a pull request.

If you can't figure it out you can always try these steps

1. Install Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenual Xerus)
    - Go to http://www.ubuntu.com/download, download Ubuntu, setup a live cd using Rufus, and install Ubuntu with the live cd
    - Alternatively you can follow https://builtvisible.com/the-ubuntu-installation-guide/
2. Follow the setup instructions for Ubuntu seen above.
